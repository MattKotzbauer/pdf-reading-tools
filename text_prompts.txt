Can you summarize the portion of the article between the text "Precision of fold change estimates We benchmarked the DESeq2 approach of using an empirical prior to achieve shrinkage of LFC estimates against two compet- ing approaches: the GFOLD method, which can analyze experiments without replication [20] and can also han-" and "While simulation is useful to verify how well an algorithm behaves with idealized theoretical data, and hence can ver- ify that the algorithm performs as expected under its own assumptions, simulations cannot inform us how well the theory fits reality. With RNA-seq data, there is the com- plication of not knowing fully or directly the underlying"? The excerpts don't have to be an exact match: as long as a section contains 10 or so words in the excerpt, consider it valid as a starting / ending point. Please put the summary in markdown syntax, suitable for compilation to a beamer slide presentation to be compiled with pandoc. Also, do not include unicode characters, please put everything in LaTeX syntax. Also, do not include the YAML front matter.
