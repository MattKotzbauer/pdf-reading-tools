Can you summarize the portion of the text between "Precision of fold change estimates We benchmarked the DESeq2 approach of using an empirical prior to achieve shrinkage of LFC estimates against two compet- ing approaches: the GFOLD method, which can analyze experiments without replication [20] and can also han-" (page 10 at character 500) and "While simulation is useful to verify how well an algorithm behaves with idealized theoretical data, and hence can ver- ify that the algorithm performs as expected under its own assumptions, simulations cannot inform us how well the theory fits reality. With RNA-seq data, there is the com- plication of not knowing fully or directly the underlying" (page 10 at character 2368).

Can you summarize the portion of the text between "False positive rate To evaluate the false positive rate of the algorithms, we considered mock comparisons from a dataset with many samples and no known condition dividing the samples into distinct groups. We used the RNA-seq data of Pickrell et al. [17] for lymphoblastoid" (page 11 at character 1115) and "tions are unsuitable and so avoids type-I errors caused by these. The embedding of these strategies in the frame- work of GLMs enables the treatment of both simple and complex designs." (page 13 at character 936).
