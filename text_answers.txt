\section{Precision of fold change estimates}

The DESeq2 method utilizes an empirical prior for shrinkage of log fold change (LFC) estimates. It was compared against the GFOLD method and the edgeR package. 

\begin{itemize}
\item DESeq2 consistently demonstrated low root-mean-square error and mean absolute error across various sample sizes and distribution models of true LFCs.
\item GFOLD performed similarly to DESeq2 across all genes, but showed poorer performance for differentially expressed genes, especially in larger sample sizes.
\item edgeR, with default settings, performed well for differentially expressed genes but had higher error rates across all genes compared to DESeq2.
\end{itemize}

\section{Clustering performance}

Performance comparisons for different transformation or distance calculation methods in clustering recovery were conducted:

\begin{itemize}
\item Different metrics such as Euclidean distance, Poisson distance, and distances in other transformed counts (e.g., rlog-transformed, VST counts) were tested against true clusters using the adjusted Rand index.
\item The rlog transformation generally outperformed other methods especially when size factors varied across samples. It was found adequate for several applications beyond distance calculation.
\end{itemize}
