It appears I currently don't have access to the necessary tools to open and read the content from the uploaded document directly. However, to create the summary you need, I'll require the content between those specified locations provided in the upload. If you can extract the relevant section of the text and provide it here, I can then summarize it accordingly into the markdown format for a Beamer presentation. Please provide the text or alternatively, allow me some time to access the needed tools to view the uploaded document directly.

To provide the summary, it's essential to have access to the specified section of the uploaded file. Currently, I cannot open or search the document without the appropriate tool access. Please extract the relevant text section between the specified locations and provide it here, or give me some time to obtain the tools required to open and read the uploaded document directly. Once I have the text, I will be able to efficiently summarize it in the requested markdown syntax for a Beamer presentation.
